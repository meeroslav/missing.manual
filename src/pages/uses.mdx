# Uses

Although I try to keep my setup as minimal as possible, I often end getting stuff to improve my workflows.

## Hardware

#### [13" MacBook Pro (Early 2015)](https://everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/specs/macbook-pro-core-i5-2.7-13-early-2015-retina-display-specs.html)

It's an old machine now, but still does the job. The only time I feel the limitations is when I work with photo editing.
I've used iMac before with more SSD and RAM, but portability of MacBook was a deciding factor which one gets sold first. Inside the box:

  - Samsung Evo 970 500GB SSD
  - 8GB RAM
  - Running OSX Catalina

Originally it had 128GB drive. Once it became primary machine, SSD had to be replaced by bigger [Evo 970 500GB](https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/memory-storage/solid-state-drives/ssd-970-evo-nvme-m2-500gb-mz-v7e500bw/)

#### [Logitech Ergo K860](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/k860-split-ergonomic-keyboard)

Ever since I tried [Microsoft Sculpt](https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/products/keyboards/sculpt-ergonomic-desktop/l5v-00001) ergonomic keyboard I was looking for something similar that works nicely with OSX. Logitech feels better than Microsoft Sculpt does. And yes, I do use the numpad occasionaly.

#### [Logitech MX Master 2S](https://www.logitech.com/en-ph/product/mx-master-2s-flow)

Simply the best mouse I ever used. I've used [Apple's Magic Mouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Mouse) before that, which is nice but not ergonomic.

#### [24" DELL Ultrasharp U2414H monitor](https://www.dell.com/hr/business/p/dell-u2414h/pd)

I've use it as a secondary screen for my old iMac. Now it's waiting to be replaced by something with bigger screen real estate.

#### [Alesis Elevate 5 Studio Monitors](https://www.alesis.com/products/legacy/elevate-5)

They have very clear and accurate sound, especially in the sweet spot where I sit. I had to replace cables, though, as the ones provided were crap.

#### [Beats EP Headphones](https://www.beatsbydre.com/headphones/beats-ep)

I know what you're thinking. I'm not a fan of Beats neither, but EPs provide very clear sound and I got them on crazy discout.
I do own a pair of old Sennheisers, worn out, leftover from my DJ-ing days.

## Software

#### [JetBrains Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)

## Office

#### [Vitra MedaPal chair](https://www.design-bestseller.de/vitra-medapal-ohne-verstellbare-lumbalstuetze.html?sku=808080&cpkey=qgfi_Yb23Jr11znM77K45OkBV2rcSCUx-bnyK3SHKtTznATVMqHUeBWXz8h8SByQ&gclid=Cj0KCQjw7qn1BRDqARIsAKMbHDaHeSBkXYWACjTNGbUSc6guypmmkXbr-JsmIHokJXNAgV9L5sdrLJIaAsRfEALw_wcB)

I had this chair at my first company and now at 5G Systems, and loved it. Some guy was selling it

#### [IKEA Linmon Tabletop](https://www.ikea.com/at/de/p/linnmon-tischplatte-weiss-eicheneff-wlas-20353741/) with two [IKEA Alex drawers](https://www.ikea.com/at/de/p/alex-schubladenelement-schwarzbraun-40342285/) as a stand

A nice and cheep setup with a lot of storage space.

## Other gear

#### [Canon 6D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_EOS_6D)

I've had multiple DSLR and non-DSLR cameras and finally settled with 6D. It's light enough for travel and full-frame gives pictures amazing clarity.

#### [Canon 35mm IS f/2](https://www.kenrockwell.com/canon/lenses/35mm-is.htm)

After several very good lenses, including [Canon 24-105 f/4 L IS](https://www.kenrockwell.com/canon/lenses/24-105mm.htm) (great do-it-all lens), [Canon 50mm f/1.8 STM](https://www.kenrockwell.com/canon/lenses/50mm-f18-stm.htm) (super sharp portrait lens) and [Canon 70-200mm f/4 L](https://www.kenrockwell.com/canon/lenses/70-200mm-f4.htm) (amazing for wildlife or portraits), this became my goto lens.
Being fixed lens forces you to use your feet for zooming, which in return opens door to creativity.

#### [M-Audio Keystation Mini 32](https://m-audio.com/products/view/keystation-mini-32)

A great little MIDI keyboard that goes perfectly along with notebooks.

#### [iPhone 11](https://www.apple.com/iphone-11)

#### [Garmin Fenix 5](https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/p/552982)

#### [Logitech R400 Presentation Remote](https://www.logitech.com/en-sg/product/wireless-presenter-r400)

#### [Metabo BS 18 Li](https://www.metabo.com/at/de/maschinen/akku-geraete/akkuschrauber-akku-bohrschrauber/bs-18-602207500-akku-bohrschrauber.html)

This hand drill is my main tool for all the house works along with [IKEA Fixa tools](https://www.ikea.com/at/de/p/fixa-werkzeugsatz-17-tlg-00169254/).
