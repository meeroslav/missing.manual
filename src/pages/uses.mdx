<H>Uses</H>

Although I try to keep my setup as minimal as possible, I often end getting stuff to improve my workflows.

## Hardware

### [13" MacBook Pro m1 (Late 2020)](https://everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/specs/macbook-pro-m1-8-core-13-2020-specs.html)

### [Keychron K8](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k8-tenkeyless-wireless-mechanical-keyboard) with Gateron Brown switches

### Logitech MX Master 3S

Simply the best mouse I ever used. I've used [Apple's Magic Mouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Mouse) before that, which is nice but not ergonomic.

## Sound and video

### [Native Instruments Komplete Audio 2](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/audio-interfaces/komplete-audio-1-audio-2/)

### [RØDE PodMic](https://rode.com/en/microphones/broadcast/podmic) dynamic microphone with [Klark Teknik CT 1](https://www.klarkteknik.com/product.html?modelCode=P0E2N) booster

### [RØDE PSA1 boom arm](https://rode.com/en/accessories/stands-bars/psa1)

### [Alesis Elevate 5 Studio Monitors](https://www.alesis.com/products/legacy/elevate-5)

They have very clear and accurate sound, especially in the sweet spot where I sit. I had to replace cables, though, as the ones provided were crap.

### [Arturia MiniLab 3 controller](https://www.arturia.com/products/hybrid-synths/minilab-3/overview)

### [Teenage Engineering PO-133 Street Fighter](https://teenage.engineering/store/po-133-street-fighter/)

## Software

### [Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)

I use Webstorm for my Angular projects and when I need more IntelliSense. IntelliSense and refactoring possibilities are unparalleled.

### [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

I'm trying to switch to Code these days. There are still parts from Webstorm I'm missing on a daily basis
but I'm slowly getting there.

### [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)

Simply the best Java editor out there. I've used also [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) and [Resharper](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/) for .Net projects, [Ruby Mine](https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/) and [PhpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/).
JetBrains tools increase productivity noticeably.

## Office

### IKEA IDÅSEN desk with custom table top

### [Autonomous ErgoChair Pro](https://www.autonomous.ai/office-chairs/ergonomic-chair)

### [IKEA Sigfinn monitor stand](https://www.ikea.com/at/de/p/sigfinn-monitorerhoehung-bambusfurnier-20362929/)

## Other gear

### [Canon RP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_EOS_RP)

I've had multiple DSLR and non-DSLR cameras. My last favourite was 6D, but while having another mirorless (Canon M6) I realized how much I used the articulated screen, direct connection to phone and video features.
Also the mirorless technology with RF lenses is now comparable (if not better) than EF lenses. I've sold my 6D and bought RP, which is a great camera for the price. Still very light and compact, but with a lot of features.

### [Canon RF 24-105mm f/4L IS USM](https://www.kenrockwell.com/canon/eos-r/lenses/24-105mm.htm)

This is my current go to lens. It's a great walkaround lens, and I use it for most of my photos. It's sharp, has great colours and contrast. I used to have EF version, and the RF version excels at this segment.

### [Canon EF 35mm f/2 IS USM](https://www.kenrockwell.com/canon/lenses/35mm-is.htm)

After several very good lenses, including [Canon 24-105 f/4 L IS](https://www.kenrockwell.com/canon/lenses/24-105mm.htm) (great do-it-all lens), [Canon 50mm f/1.8 STM](https://www.kenrockwell.com/canon/lenses/50mm-f18-stm.htm) (super sharp portrait lens) and [Canon 70-200mm f/4 L](https://www.kenrockwell.com/canon/lenses/70-200mm-f4.htm) (amazing for wildlife or portraits), this became my favourite lens.
Being a fixed lens forces you to use your feet for zooming, which in return opens door to creativity.

Unfortunately, with switch to RF mount, I realized this is no longer optimal. The new RF 35mm f1.8 is faster (f1.8 vs f2.0), quieter (STM vs USM) and does less focus hunting. Last but not least, using my current lens with adapter makes it as long as my 24-105mm L lens, which defeats the purpose of having a small fixed lens.

### [Garmin Fenix 5](https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/p/552982)

### [Logitech R400 Presentation Remote](https://www.logitech.com/en-sg/product/wireless-presenter-r400)

## Previous gear/equipment

### [13" MacBook Pro (Early 2015)](https://everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/specs/macbook-pro-core-i5-2.7-13-early-2015-retina-display-specs.html)

It's an old machine now, but still does the job. The only time I feel the limitations is when I work with photo editing.
I've used iMac before with more SSD and RAM, but the portability of the MacBook was a deciding factor which one gets sold first. Inside the box:

- Samsung Evo 970 500GB SSD
- 8GB RAM
- Running OSX Catalina

Originally it had 128GB drive. Once it became my primary machine, SSD had to be replaced by the bigger [Evo 970 500GB](https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/memory-storage/solid-state-drives/ssd-970-evo-nvme-m2-500gb-mz-v7e500bw/)

### [Logitech Ergo K860](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/k860-split-ergonomic-keyboard)

Ever since I tried [Microsoft Sculpt](https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/products/keyboards/sculpt-ergonomic-desktop/l5v-00001) ergonomic keyboard I was looking for something similar that works nicely with OSX. Logitech feels better than Microsoft Sculpt does. And yes, I do use the numpad occasionally.

### [24" DELL Ultrasharp U2414H monitor](https://www.dell.com/hr/business/p/dell-u2414h/pd)

I've used it as a secondary screen for my old iMac. It was replaced by another Dell with bigger screen real estate.

### [Beats EP Headphones](https://www.beatsbydre.com/headphones/beats-ep)

I know what you're thinking. I'm not a fan of Beats neither, but EPs provide very clear sound and I got them on a crazy discount.
I do own a pair of old Sennheisers, worn out, leftover from my DJ-ing days.

### [Canon 6D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_EOS_6D)

I've had multiple DSLR and non-DSLR cameras and finally settled with 6D. It's light enough for travel and full-frame gives pictures amazing clarity.

### [M-Audio Keystation Mini 32](https://m-audio.com/products/view/keystation-mini-32)

A great little MIDI keyboard that goes perfectly along with notebooks. Unfortunately, the connector got broken after a few years of use. Something that can be easily fixed with soldering gun, which I don't have.

### [iPhone 11](https://www.apple.com/iphone-11)

### [Vitra MedaPal chair](https://www.design-bestseller.de/vitra-medapal-ohne-verstellbare-lumbalstuetze.html?sku=808080&cpkey=qgfi_Yb23Jr11znM77K45OkBV2rcSCUx-bnyK3SHKtTznATVMqHUeBWXz8h8SByQ&gclid=Cj0KCQjw7qn1BRDqARIsAKMbHDaHeSBkXYWACjTNGbUSc6guypmmkXbr-JsmIHokJXNAgV9L5sdrLJIaAsRfEALw_wcB)

I had this chair at my first company and now at 5G Systems, and loved it. Some guy was selling used pair for peanuts so I bought both, and some weeks later sold the second one for 10x more.
