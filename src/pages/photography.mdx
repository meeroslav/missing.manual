<H>Photography</H>

I occasionally like to take photos with my phone or camera.
You can check some of my last published photos from Instagram.
You can check all my gear [here](../uses).

<Gallery />

export const pageQuery = graphql`
  query {
    cover: file(absolutePath: { regex: "/pages/photography.jpeg/" }) {
      childImageSharp {
        fluid(maxWidth: 2000, maxHeight: 400, cropFocus: CENTER) {
          ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid
        }
      }
    }
  }
`;
