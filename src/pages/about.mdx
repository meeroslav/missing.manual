# About

I'm Miroslav Jonas, a software developer based in Vienna, Austria. I was born and raised in Serbia
where I lived in two beautiful towns - Kovaƒçica and Novi Sad.
Currently I work at 5G Systems, creating a betting solutions of the future.

<p>
I occasionally write. You can find some of my thoughts on technology in the <Link to={'blog'}>blog</Link> section.
I also organize <ExternalLink to="https://www.meetup.com/Angular-Vienna/">Angular Vienna</ExternalLink> and
<ExternalLink to="https://viennajs.org/">Vienna JS</ExternalLink> meetups and try to help and grow the Angular community
in Austria via <ExternalLink to="https://angular-austria.at">Angular Austria Association</ExternalLink>.
When I learn something cool, I like to share it live on stage. You can see the list of my past and upcoming talks in
the <Link to={'talks'}>talks</Link> section.

My parent bought me my first computer when I was still kid. Lack of access to quality games forced me to
be creative with my computer - whether it's development, computer graphics or composing music.
Some of that creative experiments will see the light of the internet on this website soon.

I like to travel and discover new countries, cultures and cuisines. While there I take candid street photos of
the everyday life.
