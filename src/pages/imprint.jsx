        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>The protection of your personal data is very important to me. Therefore I process your data exclusively on
          the basis of the legal regulations (DSGVO, TKG 2003). In this privacy policy I inform you about the most
          important aspects of data processing within this website.</p>

        <h2> Contact me </h2>
        <p>If you have additional questions or require more information about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to
          contact me through email at <ExternalLink to={'mailto:missing.manual@gmail.com'}>missing.manual@gmail.com</ExternalLink>. Your mail can be stored up to six months to process and
          in case of follow-up questions. I will not share your information without your consent.</p>

        <h2> Cookies </h2>
        <p>This website uses so-called cookies. These are small text files that are stored on your device using the
          browser. They do no harm.</p>
        <p>Cookies remain stored on your device until you delete them. They allow me to recognize your browser on your
          next visit.</p>
        <p>If you do not want this, you can set up your browser so that it informs you about the setting of cookies and
          you allow this only in individual cases.</p>
        <p>The deactivation of cookies may limit the functionality of our website.</p>

        <h2> Web analytics </h2>
        <p>This website uses functions of the web analytics service Google Analytics. Provider is Google Inc., located
          at 1600 Amphitheater Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. For this purpose, cookies are used that allow an
          analysis of the use of the website by its users. The information generated thereby is transmitted to the
          Google server in the USA and stored there. You can prevent this by setting up your browser so that no cookies
          are stored.</p>
        <p>I have concluded a corresponding contract data processing contract with the provider.</p>
        <p>My concern within the meaning of the DSGVO (legitimate interest) is the improvement of the offer and the
          website. Since the privacy of our users is important to me, the user data is pseudonymized.</p>
        <p>Your IP address is recorded, but immediately pseudonymised (eg by deleting the last 8 bits). As a result,
          only a rough localization is possible.</p>
        <p>Data processing takes place on the basis of the statutory provisions of ยง 96 (3) TKG and Art. 6 para. 1 lit.
          a (consent) and / or f (legitimate interest) of the GDPR.</p>

            to={'https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&status=Active'}>European privacy legislation</ExternalLink>.</p>
        <p>The user data is kept for a period of 14 months.</p>
