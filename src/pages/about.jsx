            My parent bought me my first computer when I was still kid. Lack of access to quality games forced me to
            be creative with my computer - whether it's development, computer graphics or composing music.
            Some of that creative experiments will see the light of the internet on this website soon.

            I like to travel and discover new countries, cultures and cuisines. While there I take candid street photos of
            the everyday life.
